## 2026-03-07 - [Performance Insight: Array allocation in getters]
**Learning:** The `vault.allEntities` property is actually a getter that returns `Object.values(this.entities)`. Calling it multiple times allocates multiple new arrays.
**Action:** In iterative computations or `$derived` blocks in Svelte 5, explicitly call `Object.values(vault.entities)` once and cache the result locally, or iterate over keys, to avoid redundant memory allocation and GC pressure.
