## 2024-03-24 - Async Loading States

**Learning:** Found inconsistent loading states across modals, including one using an emoji (`⏳`) instead of a proper icon, and missing `aria-busy` attributes for screen readers during async operations.
**Action:** Always add `aria-busy={isLoading}` to buttons triggering async actions, and use consistent SVG spinners (`icon-[lucide--loader-2]`) instead of emojis or text-only changes to provide clear, accessible feedback.
