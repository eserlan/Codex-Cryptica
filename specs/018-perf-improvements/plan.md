# Implementation Plan: Performance Improvements

**Branch**: `018-perf-improvements` | **Date**: 2026-01-30 | **Spec**: [specs/018-perf-improvements/spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/018-perf-improvements/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature addresses performance bottlenecks identified in the Codex Cryptica web application, specifically targeting large vaults and battery-powered devices. The plan involves batching async operations in `GraphView`, optimizing adjacency map updates in `VaultStore`, switching to event-driven redraws in `Minimap`, implementing a lightweight sync check in `OracleStore`, and introducing canvas pooling for thumbnails.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Node.js 20+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Svelte 5, Cytoscape.js, `@google/generative-ai`  
**Storage**: OPFS (Origin Private File System), IndexedDB (via `idb`)  
**Testing**: Playwright (E2E), Vitest (Unit)  
**Target Platform**: Web (Mobile browsers)
**Project Type**: Monorepo (Turborepo)  
**Performance Goals**: Sub-100ms UI response, <1% idle CPU usage, smooth 60fps graph interactions.  
**Constraints**: Local-first sovereignty, offline-capable, <100ms execution for UI components.  
**Scale/Scope**: Vaults with 100+ entities, long-running chat sessions.

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

1. **Local-First Sovereignty**: PASS. All optimizations are local to the browser.
2. **Relational-First Navigation**: PASS. Enhances the responsiveness of the Cytoscape graph.
3. **Sub-100ms Performance Mandate**: PASS. Directly addresses this mandate by reducing main-thread blocking and idle CPU cycles.
4. **Atomic Worldbuilding**: PASS. Improvements are isolated to specific stores and components.
5. **System-Agnostic Core**: PASS. Logic remains independent of specific TTRPG systems.
6. **Pure Functional Core**: PASS. Optimization logic (e.g., incremental map updates) will be implemented as deterministic helper functions.
7. **Verifiable Reality**: PASS. Plan includes E2E regression testing and performance monitoring.
8. **Test-First PWA Integrity**: PASS. Maintains offline functionality while improving efficiency.

**Structure Decision**: Monorepo structure with improvements focused primarily within the `apps/web` application logic and stores.

| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
