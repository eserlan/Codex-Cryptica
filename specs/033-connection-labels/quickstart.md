# Quickstart: Using Connection Labels

## Categorizing Relationships

1.  **Open an Entity**: Click on any node to open the Detail Panel.
2.  **View Connections**: Scroll to the "Connections" or "Network" section.
3.  **Edit**: Click the edit/pencil icon on a specific connection.
4.  **Set Type**: Select **Friendly**, **Enemy**, or **Neutral** from the dropdown.
    -   *Friendly*: Represents alliances, family, or support. Renders **Green**.
    -   *Enemy*: Represents conflict, rivalry, or hatred. Renders **Red**.
    -   *Neutral*: Standard relationship. Renders **Grey**.
5.  **Add Label**: (Optional) Type a specific description like "Brother" or "Employer". This text will appear directly on the line in the graph.

## Visualizing Conflict

Open the **Graph View**. You can now instantly scan for conflict zones (clusters of red lines) or strong alliances (green networks). Use the custom labels to clarify *why* two entities are connected without opening them.
