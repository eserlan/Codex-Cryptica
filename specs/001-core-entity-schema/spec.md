# SPEC-001: Core Entity & Relationship Schema

## 1. The "Atomic Entity" Definition
Every piece of lore (NPC, Location, Item) is an Entity. In a local-first PWA, an Entity is a single Markdown file with a structured YAML header. This ensures the data is "Human Readable" but "Machine Actionable."

### File Structure Example (/vault/npcs/elara.md):
```yaml
---
id: "eid-7721"
type: "npc"
title: "Elara the Seer"
tags: ["mystic", "high-elf", "quest-giver"]
connections:
  - { target: "loc-silver-tower", type: "located_in", strength: 1 }
  - { target: "npc-king-thorin", type: "secret_advisor", strength: 0.8 }
---
# Elara the Seer
Elara lives in the Silver Tower and possesses the Gift of Sight...
```

## 2. The Relationship Engine (Cytoscape Integration)
The PWA will parse these YAML headers to build the elements array required by Cytoscape.js.

*   **Nodes**: Represent the Entities.
*   **Edges**: Represent the connections array.
*   **Live-Sync**: When a user types `[[Link]]` in the Tiptap editor, a background process (Web Worker) must update the connections array in the YAML and trigger a `cy.add()` event in the graph.

## 3. Technical Requirements (The "First Commit" Stack)
To get this spec off the ground, the initial repository should be initialized with:

| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Framework** | **SvelteKit** | Core PWA structure and routing. |
| **Styling** | **Tailwind CSS v4** | Utility-first styling with modern PostCSS pipeline. |
| **State** | **Svelte Stores** | Managing the active "Graph State" and "Editor State." |
| **Database** | **RxDB + OPFS** | Local-first persistence and reactive queries. |
| **Graph UI** | **Cytoscape.js** | The primary spatial navigation and relationship view. |
| **Text Editor** | **Tiptap** | Framework-agnostic editor core with custom extensions. |

## 4. Implementation Milestone 1: The "Sync Loop"
The goal of the first sprint is to achieve the "Triangle of Truth":

1.  **Edit Text**: User writes `[[King Thorin]]` in the editor.
2.  **Update Graph**: A node for "King Thorin" appears instantly in the Cytoscape view.
3.  **Persist File**: The YAML in `elara.md` is updated on the local file system.
