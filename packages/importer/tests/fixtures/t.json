    "content": "Brandr walks into a room like the tide coming in — slow, unstoppable, carrying the weight of centuries. Broad-shouldered and bearded, with long hair tied back and streaked with silver, he has the look of a man who once commanded a ship in stormy seas. \n\n### Appearance\nAcross his arms, throat, and knuckles coil tattoos: Norse runes, longships, wolves, and scars of faith. His clothes are anachronistic but powerful — a heavy leather jacket that fits him like armour, silver rings, and chains that gleam like trophies. \n\n### Personality\nHe is both **sword and spark**: a warrior with brutal strength, and a firebrand who ignites passion and rebellion. He cannot abide betrayal, and when provoked, his fury is as sudden and violent as a storm at sea. \n\n### Modern Life\nIn modern London, Brandr leads **The Oathbound**, a crew of bikers, pagans, and outcasts. Despite his predator nature, he harbors an unexpected fondness for medieval fairs and historical reenactments, where he met his Touchstone, **Edward “Ned” Ashcroft**.\n\n### Attributes\n*   **Clan**: Brujah\n*   **Generation**: 10th\n*   **Predator Type**: Osiris\n*   **Ambition**: To rise from Captain to Jarl.",
