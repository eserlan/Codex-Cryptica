## AI Intelligence

The Oracle is powered by **Google Gemini**. It doesn't just 'chat'; it retrieves relevant lore from your graph to provide context-aware answers.

### Features

- **Context Fusion**: Combines visible chronicles and hidden lore.
- **Image Generation**: Type `/draw [description]` to visualize your world.
- **Instant Visualization**: Advanced Tier users will see a "DRAW VISUAL" button on Oracle responses and empty Entity profiles to quickly generate images based on lore.
