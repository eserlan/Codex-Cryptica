## Your AI Assistant

The Lore Oracle is an AI powered by **Google Gemini**. Unlike standard AI, it actually reads your campaign files to help you brainstorm and remember details.

### What it can do

- **Context Search**: Ask "Who is the ruler of Oakhaven?" and it will find the answer in your notes.
- **Generate Images**: Type `/draw [description]` to create art for your characters or locations.
- **Suggest Links**: It can find themes or relationships you might have missed and suggest them as new connections.
