## Command Discovery

The Lore Oracle supports several interactive commands to help you manage your world. To discover available commands, simply type a forward slash (`/`) in the chat input.

### Available Commands

- `/draw [subject]`: Triggers the AI to generate a visual representation of the subject.
- `/create [description]`: Ask the Oracle to draft a new entity record based on your description.
- `/connect oracle`: Opens the **Connection Wizard**, a guided tool to help you link two entities with AI-suggested relationship types.
- `/connect [NL statement]`: Link entities directly using natural language (e.g., `/connect Eldrin is the mentor of Kaelen`).

## Connection Wizard

The Connection Wizard simplifies building your knowledge graph:

1. **Select Source**: Choose the starting entity.
2. **Select Target**: Choose the destination entity.
3. **AI Proposal**: The Oracle analyzes the lore of both entities to suggest a thematic relationship.
4. **Review & Save**: Customize the type or label before saving the connection to your vault.
