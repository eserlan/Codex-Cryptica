# Terminal Landing Page

The Terminal Landing Page serves as the initial entry point for Codex Cryptica, designed to introduce users to the core operational protocols while maintaining a high-performance, SEO-friendly surface for search engines.

## Operational Protocols

The landing page highlights several key "Protocols" that define the application:

- **Local-First Architecture**: Your data is stored in the Origin Private File System (OPFS) and remains strictly on your local machine.
- **Privacy-Centric Intelligence**: All AI processing via the Oracle respects your privacy and data sovereignty.
- **Zero-Cloud Dependency**: The core application functions entirely without external cloud requirements, ensuring 100% offline availability.

## Navigating the Terminal

- **Enter Workspace**: Click this button to transition from the public landing page into your private workspace.
- **Hide Welcome Screen**: You can choose to skip the landing page on future visits by checking this box on the terminal or toggling it in **Settings > Aesthetics**.
- **Features Index**: Visit `/features` at any time for a deep dive into the technical specifications and capabilities of the system.

## Performance & SEO

The landing page is optimized for near-instant load times (LCP < 1.2s) and provides crawlable metadata for search engines, ensuring that Codex Cryptica remains discoverable while your private notes stay hidden.
