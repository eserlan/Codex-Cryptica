## Hiding Information

The **Fog of War** system lets you track what your players have discovered. You can hide nodes on the graph so they don't see spoilers during a session.

### Visibility States

- **Revealed**: Everyone can see this node and its links.
- **Hidden**: Only you (the GM) can see this entry in the list, but it's gone from the graph.
- **Rumor (Link Only)**: A "ghost" node that appears when an entry is mentioned but not yet fully discovered.

### How to Reveal

1. **Right-Click**: Tap a node and look for the Visibility menu.
2. **Toggle Reveal**: Click to show or hide it from the graph.
3. **GM View**: Click the **Eye Icon** in the bottom controls to see everything at once, regardless of Fog of War.
