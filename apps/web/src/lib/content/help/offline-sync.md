## Your Data is Private

Codex Cryptica is "Local-First." This means your campaign data is stored on your machine, not on our servers.

### Using Google Drive

If you want to access your notes on multiple computers, you can enable **Google Drive Sync** in the settings.

- **Direct Connection**: Codex connects directly to your personal Google Drive.
- **Automatic Updates**: When you save a file on one computer, it will automatically update on your other devices.
- **Secure**: Only you have access to your files.
