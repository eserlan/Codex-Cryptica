## Finding Hidden Links

The **Connections Proposer** works in the background to find relationships you might have forgotten to link in the graph.

### How to use it

1. **Automatic Scan**: While you read or edit an entry, the AI looks for names or themes mentioned in other files.
2. **Reviewing Suggestions**: Check the **Oracle Suggestions** panel at the bottom of the screen.
3. **Creating the Link**: If a suggestion looks good, click the checkmark to add it to your graph permanently.

> [!TIP]
> The more detailed your notes are, the better the AI becomes at finding interesting connections between your characters and locations.
