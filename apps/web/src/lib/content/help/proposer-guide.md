## Automated Discovery

The **Connections Proposer** works in the background to find hidden links between your entities. It uses the Lore Oracle to analyze your writing and suggest relationships you might have missed.

### How it Works

1. **Background Scan**: When you view an entity, the system silently checks for potential links to other records.
2. **Review**: Suggestions appear at the bottom of the detail panel.
3. **Apply**: Click the checkmark to create a real connection.
4. **Dismiss**: Click 'X' to ignore. Dismissed suggestions are saved in history just in case.
