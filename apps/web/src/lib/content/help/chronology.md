# Custom Chronology

Codex Arcana allows you to define the very structure of time for your campaign world. Gone are the days of manual math or being forced into a standard Earth calendar.

## The Date Picker

When editing an entity's date, start date, or end date, you will now see a theme-aware **Date Picker**.

### Era-Centric Navigation

Instead of scrolling through thousands of years, you can select an **Era** (defined in your Vault Settings). Selecting an Era will automatically snap the year input to the beginning of that period, allowing for rapid narrative-based data entry.

### Precision Levels

Not every event needs a specific day. The picker allows you to choose your granularity:

- **Year**: Just the big picture.
- **Month**: For seasonal events.
- **Day**: For specific historical moments.

## Campaign Calendars

In the **Vault Settings**, you can fully customize your world's calendar:

1. **Standard Gregorian**: Keep this enabled to use the standard 12-month calendar we all know.
2. **Custom Months**: Disable Gregorian mode to define your own months. You can rename them (e.g., "Hammer", "Alturiak") and even change how many days each month has.
3. **Epoch Suffixes**: Add suffixes like "AF" (After Fall) or "BCE" to your years for better immersion.
4. **Present Year**: Set a "Present" marker to anchor your narrative timeline.

## Linear Time Mapping

Regardless of how many months or days you define, the Knowledge Graph automatically calculates a linear value for each date. This ensures that even the most complex custom calendars are visualized correctly on the **World Timeline**.
