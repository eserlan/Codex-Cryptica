# Custom Chronology

Codex Arcana allows you to define the very structure of time for your campaign world. Gone are the days of manual math or being forced into a standard Earth calendar.

## The Date Picker

When editing an entity's temporal data (Date, Start Date, or End Date), you will use the tactile **Date Picker**.

### Tactile Year Selection

The year picker uses a grid-based navigation system designed for fast, non-keyboard entry across vast timelines:

1. **Drill Down**: Click a Century to see its Decades, then click a Decade to select a specific Year.
2. **Zoom Out**: Click the header (e.g., "1200 - 1211") to jump back up to the Decade or Century view.
3. **Navigate**: Use the left/right arrows to slide the current grid forward or backward in time.

### Era-Centric Snapping

If you have defined **Eras** in your Vault Settings, you can use the "Eras" tab to instantly snap the picker to the beginning of a historical period. This is the fastest way to navigate across millennia.

### Precision Levels

The picker allows you to choose your granularity using the toggle at the top:

- **Year**: For broad historical events.
- **Month**: For seasonal occurrences.
- **Day**: For specific, high-precision moments.

## Campaign Calendars

In the **Vault Settings**, you can fully customize your world's calendar:

1. **Standard Gregorian**: Keep this enabled to use the standard 12-month calendar.
2. **Custom Months**: Disable Gregorian mode to define your own months. You can rename them (e.g., "Hammer", "Alturiak") and set custom lengths.
3. **Epoch Suffixes**: Add suffixes like "AF" (After Fall) or "BCE" to your years for immersion.
4. **Present Year**: Set a "Present" marker to anchor your narrative timeline.

## Linear Time Mapping

Regardless of how many months or days you define, the Knowledge Graph automatically calculates a linear value for each date. This ensures that even the most complex custom calendars are visualized correctly on the **World Timeline**.
