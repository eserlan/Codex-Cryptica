## Welcome to the Archive

Codex Cryptica is designed to give you **absolute sovereignty** over your lore. Everything you write is saved as a Markdown file in your local vault.

### Core Concepts

- **Entities**: The building blocks of your world (NPCs, Locations, Items).
- **Chronicles**: The main text content of an entity.
- **Lore**: Hidden attributes and meta-data used by the Oracle for context.
