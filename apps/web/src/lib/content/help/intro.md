## Welcome to Codex Cryptica

Codex Cryptica is a campaign management tool designed around **Digital Sovereignty**. This means your lore stays on your computer—we don't use external servers to store your data.

### Core Concepts

- **Entities**: The main entries in your world, like NPCs, Locations, or Factions.
- **Chronicles**: The primary text (Markdown) for each entry.
- **Lore (Metadata)**: Specific details like "Status" or "Tags" stored in the file's header.
- **The Graph**: A visual map showing how all your entries are connected.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since everything is stored locally, remember to back up your vault folder or enable Google Drive sync in the settings.
