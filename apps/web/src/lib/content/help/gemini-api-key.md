## Get your Gemini API Key

Codex Cryptica uses Google Gemini to power its AI features. To use the "Lore Oracle" or "Suggested Connections," you'll need to provide your own API key.

### How to get a key

1. **Visit Google AI Studio**: Go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. **Create Key**: Click **'Create API key'**.
3. **Paste in Codex**: Go to **Settings > Intelligence** and paste your key.

> [!NOTE]
> Your key is stored safely in your browser. It is never sent to our servers; it only talks directly to Google when you ask the Oracle a question.

### Why use a key?

Using your own key allows for faster responses and gives the AI more "context" about your world, making its suggestions much more accurate.
