## Consolidation Power

Sometimes duplicate entities appear, especially after importing content. The **Merge Nodes** feature allows you to combine them into a single, definitive record.

### How to Merge

1. **Select Nodes**: Hold `Shift` or `Ctrl` and click multiple nodes in the Graph View.
2. **Right-Click**: Open the context menu on one of the selected nodes.
3. **Select 'Merge Nodes'**: This opens the merge dialog.

### Merge Strategies

- **Concatenate**: Simply appends the content of all source nodes into the target node.
- **AI Merge**: Uses the Oracle (Gemini) to intelligently rewrite and summarize the combined lore into a cohesive entry.

**Warning**: The source nodes will be permanently deleted after merging. The target node will be updated.
