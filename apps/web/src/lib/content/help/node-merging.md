## Cleaning up Duplicates

If you accidentally create two entries for the same person or place, you can merge them into one.

### How to Merge

1. **Select Nodes**: Hold `Shift` and click the nodes you want to combine in the graph.
2. **Right-Click**: Click on one of the selected nodes and choose **'Merge Nodes'**.
3. **Choose a Method**:
   - **Combine**: Simply puts all the text from both files into one.
   - **AI Rewrite**: Asks the Oracle to rewrite the two entries into one smooth, cohesive story.

> [!CAUTION]
> Once you merge, the extra nodes are deleted and the data is moved to the "Primary" node. This cannot be easily undone!
