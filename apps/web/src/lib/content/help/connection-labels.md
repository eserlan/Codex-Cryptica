## Labeling Your Links

Not every connection is the same. You can add labels to the lines in your graph to show _how_ people or places are related.

### How to Add Labels

1. **Connect Nodes**: Press `C`, click the first node, then the second.
2. **Type the Label**: A small box will appear. Type things like "Enemy," "Child of," or "Home Town."
3. **Hide Labels**: If your graph gets too cluttered, press `L` to hide the text on the lines.

### AI Context

The Lore Oracle understands these labels. If you label someone as a "Rival," the AI will remember that conflict when you ask for plot ideas!
