## Switch Between Campaigns

Codex Cryptica lets you manage multiple "Vaults" (folders). Each vault is completely separate, so your sci-fi notes won't mix with your fantasy ones.

### How to Switch

1. **Vault Name**: Look at the top-left of the screen.
2. **Click Name**: This opens the Vault Switcher.
3. **Add or Switch**: You can jump to a vault you've used before or "Add Archive" to link a new folder.

> [!NOTE]
> Your AI API Key works for all vaults, but things like NPC categories and tags are unique to each campaign.
