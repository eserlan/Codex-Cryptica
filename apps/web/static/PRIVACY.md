# Privacy Policy for Codex Arcana

**Last Updated: 2026-01-29**

Codex Arcana is a local-first application designed to help creators manage lore and world-building data. We respect your privacy and provide this policy to explain how your data is handled.

## 1. Local-First Data Sovereignty
Your data is yours. By default, all "Vaults," entities, notes, and images are stored locally on your device using browser technologies (Origin Private File System and IndexedDB).
- We do not have access to your local files.
- We do not store your data on our own servers.

## 2. Google Drive Integration (Optional)
If you choose to enable Cloud Sync, Codex Arcana will request access to your Google Drive.
- **Scope**: The application uses the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` scope. This allows the app to only see and manage files that it has created or that you have specifically opened with it.
- **Usage**: The app mirrors your local vault to a folder in your Google Drive to provide backup and multi-device synchronization.
- **Data Sharing**: We do not share your Google Drive data with any third parties.

## 3. Google Gemini AI Usage
Codex Arcana integrates with Google Gemini API for features like "Lore Oracle" (AI analysis) and Image Generation.
- **Data Transfer**: When you use these features, specific content from your vault (text for analysis or prompts for images) is sent to Google's servers.
- **Google's Privacy**: The processing of this data is subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Generative AI Terms](https://ai.google.dev/terms).

## 4. No Tracking or Cookies
Codex Arcana does not use advertising cookies, tracking scripts, or analytics packages. The only data collected is standard server-side logs if the application is accessed via a public URL, which are used solely for troubleshooting and security.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy occasionally. Continued use of the application after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

## 6. Contact
For questions regarding this policy, please contact the developer at [Your Contact Info].
