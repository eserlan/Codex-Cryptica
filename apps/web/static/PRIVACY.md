# Privacy Policy for Codex Cryptica

**Last Updated: 2026-01-29**

Codex Cryptica is a local-first application designed to help creators manage lore and world-building data. We respect your privacy and provide this policy to explain how your data is handled.

## 1. Local-First Data Sovereignty

Your data is yours. By default, all "Vaults," entities, notes, and images are stored locally on your device using browser technologies (Origin Private File System and IndexedDB).

- We do not have access to your local files.
- We do not store your data on our own servers.

## 2. Google Drive Integration (Optional)

If you choose to enable Cloud Sync, Codex Cryptica will request access to your Google Drive.

- **Scope**: The application uses the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` scope. This allows the app to only see and manage files that it has created or that you have specifically opened with it.
- **Usage**: The app mirrors your local vault to a folder in your Google Drive to provide backup and multi-device synchronization.
- **Data Sharing**: We do not share your Google Drive data with any third parties.

### Use of Google User Data

**Codex Cryptica's** use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.

We only access your Google Drive to store and retrieve campaign files (lore, images, and configuration) that you explicitly create or select within the app. We do not share, sell, or use this data for any purpose other than providing the Campaign Assistant functionality.

## 3. Google Gemini AI Usage

Codex Cryptica integrates with Google Gemini API for features like "Lore Oracle" (AI analysis) and Image Generation.

- **Data Transfer**: When you use these features, specific content from your vault (text for analysis or prompts for images) is sent to Google's servers.
- **Google's Privacy**: The processing of this data is subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Generative AI Terms](https://ai.google.dev/terms).

## 4. No Tracking

Codex Cryptica does not use advertising cookies, tracking scripts, or server-side logging. All application state is maintained locally in your browser. When hosted as a static site, no data about your usage is collected or stored by the application itself.

### Analytics & Privacy

We use **Cloudflare Web Analytics** to understand site traffic and improve performance. This service is privacy-first and does not use cookies, local storage, or any form of visitor tracking. All data is anonymous and used for technical optimization only.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy occasionally. Continued use of the application after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
